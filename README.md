# CS 344 Analysis of Algorithms
This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 344 at Oregon State University taken summer quarter 2020, taught by Danielle Safonte.

## Course Description

In this class I had the had the opportunity to learn the basic skills needed to design and implement a simple to moderately complex database, make good decisions regarding database design, and document your design and queries in standardized notation. Additionally, I had the opportunity to practice these skills by building a simple website driven by a database backend. By the end of the course, I was able to:

- Describe the difference between a relational database and a flat file.
- Model a moderately complex data set by using an ER diagram, and derive a relational schema from that diagram.
- Create a relational database from a relational schema.
- Create multiple indices in a relational database, and explain when and why such indices are appropriate.
- Formulate SQL statements for data manipulation.
- Formulate simple queries in relational algebra by using projection, selection, product, and join operations.
- Describe the components and interfaces of a Web-based database system.
- Design and implement a Web-based relational database system, using one or more scripting languages (e.g., PHP) and an open-source database development system (e.g., MySQL).
