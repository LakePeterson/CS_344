# CS 344 Analysis of Algorithms
This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 344 at Oregon State University taken winter quarter 2020, taught by Justin Goins.

## Course Description
In this course we learned about scripting and how it connects user programs and OS utilities together, communicating with the Operating System via system calls and utilities, creating and managing multiple processes at once, and inter-process communication, including networking. We will use UNIX as our model OS. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Explain why multiprogramming is important for modern operating systems.
- Explain the general structure of a multiprogrammed operating system.
- Explain the purpose and operation of system calls.
- Write a program utilizing system calls.
- Write a program using a scripting language.
- Explain how to use regular expressions to parse input data.
- Write a program that spawns processes and provides mutual exclusion for variables or other resources shared by the 
  processes.
- Write a program that uses sockets to implement a client/server system.
- Explain how a common file system works, including structure, I/O operations, and security.
- Describe the memory organization of a typical process in a common operating system.
- We used UNIX and C extensively in this course.
